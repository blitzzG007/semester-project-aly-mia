          <h2>"Explore together"</h2>
          <p>
            The Community Science Museum is a place where curiosity comes alive.
            Our mission is to make science accessible, exciting, and interactive
            for everyone — from young explorers to lifelong learners.<br />

            <br />Science has taken us from understanding the elements around us
            to uncovering galaxies, microorganisms, and the origins of life
            itself. At our museum, we bring these discoveries out of the
            textbook and into real life through hands-on exhibits, immersive
            experiences, and over 1000 displays across fields like cosmology,
            evolution, robotics, ecology, and medicine.<br />

            <br />We believe learning should be fun, engaging, and shared.
            Whether you’re a child discovering physics for the first time, a
            teacher planning a school visit, or a researcher looking for
            collaboration, the museum is a place to explore, experiment, and be
            inspired.<br />

            <br />Come see the wonders of science — and maybe spark a lifelong
            passion for discovery.

            <h2>Internship</h2>
            <p>
              Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun
              and excitement of sharing the wonders of nature with people? Well
              you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at the
              museum. You'll be learning from a number of different academics
              and people who are passionate about science and sharing it with
              the wider community.

            <h2>Volunteer</h2>
            <p>
              A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
              displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
              Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
              scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
              monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
              discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
              You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
              contact us if you'd like to find out more about how you can get
              involved.
